    const value = `<ol><li></li></ol><p>So this is what it feels like<br />to burn-<br />completely.<br /><ol start='2'><li></li></ol><p>Her skin,<br />burning with rage<br />her eyes lined with un-wavered purpose<br />hair as the sea-<br />treacherous, but flows, gently.<br />I want to live my life lost in her words<br />searching for her echoes<br />in the things she has touched.<br />She is wonder personified.<br />A fight against cliché.</p><ol start='3'><li></li></ol><p>I talked with her for hours<br />about falling in love.<br />Why, now, am I surprised<br />she’s the one I ended up falling for?</p><ol start='4'><li></li></ol><p>2 weeks<br />or 15 years<br />How long does not have to matter<br />because forever cannot be promised.<br />However, I will find our forever<br />in the moments we get to spend together.</p><ol start='5'><li></li></ol><p>You are-<br />but a magnificent fire<br />and your flames are consuming.<br />All I am here for<br />is to make certain that you burn<br />brilliantly.</p><ol start='6'><li></li></ol><p>I tell you my heart<br />and I look into your eyes.<br />It is clear that these are the words You long to hear.<br />But my voice<br />is not the voice you wish carried it.</p><ol start='7'><li></li></ol><p>You are the dream I never wanted to finish-<br />the nightmare I was ready to begin.</p><ol start='8'><li></li></ol><p>With a shaky arm<br />I try to reach.<br />“Be still” I say “Be still”.<br />Be still, before you hold on<br />because it is either you hang-<br />forever<br />or fall–<br />forever.</p><ol start='9'><li></li></ol><p>In this white winter<br />black bodies fall heavier<br />than dead leaves.</p><ol start='10'><li></li></ol><p>One thing to dread about winter-<br />the most beautiful things<br />are also dying.</p><ol start='11'><li></li></ol><p>The things I wouldd do to you<br />your mind<br />your heart<br />your body<br />Oh- the things I wouldd do If you let me.</p><ol start='12'><li></li></ol><p>Like a man sat by the rocks at the beach<br />I wait for the winds to blow.<br />To bring the waves and let it wash the sands.<br />I waited-<br />but the waves did not come<br />they did not crash.<br />Never had the sea been so still.</p><ol start='13'><li></li></ol><p>Finally-<br />I murder my thoughts.<br />Maybe I cannot sleep<br />because reality beckons me to change it.<br />Until then-<br />I am deprived of my dreams.</p><ol start='14'><li></li></ol><p>He sleeps in a bed of misery<br />but his dreams are filled with hope.<br />His legs cut off from his body<br />so he cannot run<br />Arms from shoulder<br />so he cannot fight<br />His tongue jacked from his mouth<br />so he does not protest<br />But his eyes-<br />They still speak a thousand words<br />of no surrender.</p><ol start='15'><li></li></ol><p>My heart is slow<br />yet you’re here, and I can feel it quicken<br />I get it<br />This is what it means<br />To feel<br />To be wanted<br />Thank you.</p><ol start='16'><li></li></ol><p>My honesty is all I have<br />and I know it is not enough.<br />I do not regret sharing the night<br />feeling your warmth<br />drowning in your arms.<br />But I told you the truth<br />I never saw us past dawn.</p><ol start='17'><li></li></ol><p>From now on<br />you are the sun.<br />You shone years before there were people alive<br />to call you beautiful.</p><ol start='18'><li></li></ol><p>I want to be a witness to your success I want to be your laughter in the afternoon<br />I want to be the moans that keep you past midnight<br />I want to be the arguments at the dinner table<br />I want to be the touch that leaves s mark on your dark skin long after I am gone<br />I want to be the quiet that comes, begging you to fill it with your favourite songs<br />It is 2:45 on a Monday afternoon, and I am sat here-<br />wanting you.</p><ol start='19'><li></li></ol><p>I asked her once<br />“Why do you look up at the sky?”<br />“Because I’m waiting” she said.<br />“For?”<br />“Something beautiful.”<br />I stared at her for a while, then said ever so sincerely<br />“Don’t take too long waiting<br />for something beautiful to fall from the sky in fiery glory,<br />that you miss the beauty growing from the earth,<br />quietly, beneath your feet.”<br />She looked at me, then looked to the ground.<br />“The flowers are truly beautiful” she said,<br />looking back at the sky<br />“But my beauty burns.”</p><ol start='20'><li></li></ol><p>She was far away.<br />So far I was never sure if she was coming or going<br />So far<br />Now all I see is the horizon.<br />Now I know.</p><ol start='21'><li></li></ol><p>Life is a disco<br />and we’re dancing in the dark</p><ol start='22'><li></li></ol><p>These are the scars I get to kiss<br />The stories,<br />with my lips, I unravel<br />You’re the flower that survives winter.<br />All I can do is water you<br />and let you enjoy the spring.</p><ol start='23'><li></li></ol><p>I smile<br />Because when I am still<br />I am satisfied with what’s gone<br />and hopeful of what’s to come.</p><ol start='24'><li></li></ol><p>I am an honest man<br />But I’ve got secrets<br />No one’s bothered to ask<br />how many birds I had to burn<br />to acquire my wings.</p><ol start='25'><li></li></ol><p>I’ll wait<br />But not for long.</p><ol start='26'><li></li></ol><p>The dream is over.<br />Good morning.</p>`
